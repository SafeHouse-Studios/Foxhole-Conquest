CWE_the_council_on_industrial_development:0 "The Council On Industrial Development"
CWE_the_council_on_industrial_development_desc:0 "Unlike the despots to our south, we Caovians have always had groups decide on matters of state. As politics and war increasingly intermingle, why should the fuel for the inevitable conflicts be any different?"
CWE_the_port_of_whedons_row:0 "The Port of Whedon's Row"
CWE_the_port_of_whedons_row_desc:0 "After we were forced out of our old capital of Sunhaven, we have had to base our government out of Whedon's Row. Even though Whedon's Row is located on the trade-rich eastern shores, the city had never been a main trading hub of our nation. As such, it is sorely lacking in suitable infrastructure for the needs of the military command and the bureaucracy. We will need to begin development on several projects within the city, which will hopefully help create jobs for the unemployed, and bolster the city's administrative capacities."
CWE_repair_central_infastructure:0 "Repair Central Infrastructure"
CWE_repair_central_infastructure_desc:0 "Our nation has thrived on trade, and the only thing more important than making products is transporting them. We should look to repair our railways, as they have fallen into disrepair over the years. Surely, something a bit stronger than just iron would be suitable for our rails?"
CWE_the_elksford_rail_line:0 "The Elksford Rail Line"
CWE_the_elksford_rail_line_desc:0 "The town of Elksford is an important manufacturing hub, but it is part of our northern territories, and is far from the frontlines. Building a railway here would make it much easier to move supplies from the factories to the battlefield, as well as making transportation cheaper. It will take some time to complete the project, as we need to bring up materials, but thankfully it's possible that we could connect the Elksford railway to our infrastructure projects in central Caovia, which will open the icy city to the rest of the nation."
CWE_create_the_lochan_birth_rail_hub:0 "Create The Lochan Birth Rail Hub"
CWE_create_the_lochan_birth_rail_hub_desc:0 "Lochan Birth is located in the central regions of our nation. It would be the perfect railroad junction for connecting the eastern and western portions of our empire's railway systems. Not only will we be able to ship goods from one half to the other, but troops and communications will be able to quickly travel wherever they're needed."
CWE_revive_the_ancient_capital:0 "Revive the Ancient Capital"
CWE_revive_the_ancient_capital_desc:0 "It has been many years since the southern barbarians had burned our great capital. With our recent advances, we have managed to push the Velish troops out of Sunhaven. Soon, Caovish flags will fly over the proud city once more."
CWE_reoccupy_the_ward:0 "Reoccupy the Ward"
CWE_reoccupy_the_ward_desc:0 "With the city of Sunhaven back in its owners' hands, we can finally begin rebuilding the homes, and filling in the shell craters. Once more, Sunhaven will be a bustling metropolis!"
CWE_the_domain_of_sunhaven:0 "The Domain Of Sunhaven"
CWE_the_domain_of_sunhaven_desc:0 "Though it has taken vast resources and manpower, we have restored the seat of our ancient capital back to its proper position. Already, our citizens cheer at this, for they know that with the crown jewel of the Empire in our hands once more, the war will soon be won. Perhaps the Velish would like to know how it feels to see their capital burned to the ground, aswell…?"
CWE_the_port_of_ogmaran:0 "The Port of Ogmaran"
CWE_the_port_of_ogmaran_desc:0 "One large oddity about Ogmaran is the fact that the city, despite its level of development, is located both on a fairly small river, as well as being rather far north. Regardless, the city has been an important part of Caovia for generations, and thus is a perfect target for infrastructural investment."
CWE_port_of_buckler_sound:0 "Port of Buckler Sound"
CWE_port_of_buckler_sound_desc:0 "Located near the tip of a peninsula, Buckler Sound is lucky enough to have access to water on multiple sides while also being accessible by land. This has allowed Buckler Sound to be a place where everything from foreign merchant vessels, to upstream coastal boats, to even trains are able to pass through while selling and purchasing goods. The city has great potential, and must be nurtured and developed so that it may become even more prosperous."
CWE_skelter_course:0 "Port of Skelter Course"
CWE_skelter_course_desc:0 "Located on a major island on the western shore of the continent, Skelter Course is a vital component in our war efforts in the west. It serves as one of our main ship production sites, and its loss would be a crippling blow to our navy. We should modernize the city, and make sure it's working at maximum proficiency, so that it can out-produce any invasion, and refit our entire armada at a moment's notice."
CWE_forward_western_factories:0 "Forward Western Factories"
CWE_forward_western_factories_desc:0 "As we make advances further south, it has become apparent that transporting weapons and supplies to the frontlines is becoming more time-consuming and expensive. Our engineers have suggested that we simply build more factories, closer to the frontlines. This will fix both our transportation issues, and will bolster arms production."
CWE_facilitate_heacy_arms_plants:0 "Facilitate Heavy Arms Plants"
CWE_facilitate_heacy_arms_plants_desc:0 "As the war rages on, bigger and more complex weapons have been developed to deal with the ever-changing battlefield. Recently, it has gotten to the point where trying to produce such weapons is seriously hampering our ability to produce basic weapons in our factories, such as rifles and uniforms. These factories simply aren't built to handle the construction of large-caliber artillary shells and heavy machine guns. Our only real option is to create specialized factories that can handle the intense workload necessary for modern conflicts."

Though it may not be feasible to widen the river to accommodate more shipping, we can still do other things to ensure that the city can output as many supplies as possible."

It's said that on any given day, you could spot at least one new flag flying over a ship docked at the massive harbor. While today, you're unlikely to see anything floating there besides gunboats or transport barges, Endless could still be used to produce a great deal of supplies for the Warden Empire, whether they come from overseas or not."
CWE_develop_soravian_aluminium_mines:0 "Develop Soravian Aluminium Mines"
CWE_develop_soravian_aluminium_mines_desc:0 "For whatever reason, there seems to be an abnormally large amount of aluminum ore located in Sorovia. This material would be perfect for usage in many of our war machines, as well as for civilian usage. It would be foolish of us to ignore how valuable this land is, and thus we should begin preparations to excavate the aluminum, and bring it back to Caovia for refinement."
CWE_forges_of_red_chapel:0 "Forges of Red Chapel"
CWE_forges_of_red_chapel_desc:0 "Unlike many places in Caovia, Sorovian cities are not very dense, and often times they lack the kind of advanced infrastructure that would otherwise allow them to produce the materials required to fight modern wars. If we want, we could begin building refineries for all of the aluminum we're digging up in Sorovia. It would help kick-start some actual development in the region, as well as lessen the burden on refineries all the way down in Caovia."
CWE_rapid_development:0 "Rapid Development "
CWE_rapid_development_desc:0 "The lands of Sorovia are woefully underdeveloped. This is unacceptable. The Sorovians wished to retain their pre-industrial lifestyles, but it has become more and more obvious that such arrangements will not work. whether they like it or not, Sorovia will have to industrialize and help support the war against the Colonials far more than they are now."
CWE_balanced_development:0 "Balanced Development"
CWE_balanced_development_desc:0 "If we simply transform Sorovia overnight, we will destroy their culture and traditions, all in the name of fighting a war to protect OUR culture and traditions. Seems sort of hypocritical, no? If we wish to truly be the "Good Guys" in this war, we have to shoe that we are looking out for everyone, and not just ourselves. "
CWE_the_state_of_the_empire:0 "The State of the Empire"
CWE_the_state_of_the_empire_desc:0 "For a good portion of Caovia's existence, 'Callahan' has been the name of many people with influence and power in the various governments that had been rooted here. Currently, a man also named 'Callahan' is in control of the Caovian state. He effectively controls the country through a group of council members, who hold total loyalty to him. However, only time can tell whether this remains the status quo, or if the imperialists to the south will upend this age-old tradition."
CWE_the_divine_right:0 "The Divine Right"
CWE_the_divine_right_desc:0 "Callahan has been the name of many leaders in Caovian history. It seems almost to have a divine connection,  which grants greatness to those with the name. It seems obvious, then, that it is destiny for the emperor Callahan to lead our nation however he sees fit. It is clearly the will of the divine that Callahan be seen as the blessed individual that he is."
CWE_maintain_royal_authority:0 "Maintain Royal Authority"
CWE_maintain_royal_authority_desc:0 "Callahan has chosen a group of people to execute his will. This is how he has decided that the government will be run, and so far it has worked fine. There is no reason to disrupt or change this system, and doing so can only invite instability and chaos."
CWE_coerce_soravian_involvement:0 "Coerce Soravian Involvement"
CWE_coerce_soravian_involvement_desc:0 "The Soravians only exist because of our generosity. So far, their assistance in return has been… lackluster, to say the least. It seems that our kindness has been repaid with apathy, and worse-- during our time of need. It's clear that the Soravians need to be 'persuaded,' and shown why exactly they should be far more involved in this war than they currently are."
CWE_develop_nicevian_resources:0 "Develop Nicevian Resources"
CWE_develop_nicevian_resources_desc:0 "The Nicevian lands are abundant in resources, and imports from them made up a good chunk of our manufacturing industry. Of course, those estimates were made when we weren't involved in a war, and thus the current imports are nowhere near adequate. If the Nevish wish to remain in good standing with us, they'll have to provide much more to us than they are now."
CWE_the_imperial_army:0 "The Imperial Army"
CWE_the_imperial_army_desc:0 "To give control of any number of soldiers to a person is risky. Handing over power is an invitation to usurpers and claimants. It doesn't matter how 'professional' or 'effective' our army is, if that strength is only being used to tear down the government. What we need is not necessarily brilliant officers, but loyal ones. The divinity of Callahan is enough to see us through any darkness, we just need to ensure that our soldiers aren't being swayed towards treasonous acts. We can focus on tactical competency once our officers learn that they're only there to tell the recruits what Callahan wants them to do."
CWE_technology_reclamation:0 "Technology Reclamation"

They are my Hands of Callahan and they shall know no fear.” - Emperor Callahan"
CWE_southwestern_protectorate_state:0 "Southwestern Protectorate State"
CWE_southwestern_protectorate_state_desc:0 "The island in Farranac Coast is among the biggest in the areas affected by the war. This makes it quite hard to patrol the entire shoreline, and the manpower required to do so would majorly hinder our regiments. A subservient 'nation' should be set up in the region, dedicated to both guarding and administering the island while we wage war."
CWE_southeastern_protectorate_state:0 "Southeastern Protectorate State"
CWE_southeastern_protectorate_state_desc:0 "The land of Endless Shore formed in such a way that it requires constant monitoring from military command to ensure the area is not lost.

CWE_at_the_gates_of_demokratos_desc:0 "The Colonials, who once stood beyond the wall, are now cowering at the gates of Damokratos. For all of their 'Imperial Glory,' they are naught but scared animals hiding in their dens. Our soldiers have captured most of the lands between Silk Farms and The Blemish, but pockets of disorganized resistance still remain on hilltops or abandoned mineshafts. In general, the main fight is over, and our High Command has been recalled to prepare for the siege of the Colonial capital."
CWE_shielded_by_the_mountains:0 "Shielded by The Mountains"
CWE_shielded_by_the_mountains_desc:0 "Northern Caoiva is covered in mountainous terrain, which makes defending it far easier than the flatlands of the south.

A series of well executed strikes are being planned to secure our regime in a day, should everything go to plan. Should our plan fail, we would rally our followers to take on the remaining Communist loyalists."

CWE_the_viper_strikes_Southward_desc:0 "As god had willed it we have won. Through our strength, Gideon has led us to victory and  we have prevailed, and a glorious new age for the Caovish people can commence. As the last of the disloyal remnants are being assigned to positions they are more suited for, we can embrace our destiny, a strike south in one final glorious victory. The final war commences, and a millenia old rivalry ends in our victory."
CWE_repair_the_nation:0 "Repair the nation"
CWE_repair_the_nation_desc:0 "Our victory in the civil war has come at heavy price, in lives as well as material. Many of our citizens don’t have access to clean water, a steady supply of food, or government sponsored information. We shall embark upon a glorious campaign to mend the wounds in our nation, and repair our infrastructure, to a state superior to that of the old regime."
CWE_the_labor_party:0 "The Labor Party"
CWE_the_labor_party_desc:0 "Though we have united with the Fascists, it does not change the fact that the only true path forward is under the unity of the workers, not politicians. The Fascists are merely autocrats that wish to use a different title to trick people into believing they are in better hands than under kings or archons. It is only through the violent uprising of the workers across Caovia that freedom can be achieved!"

CWE_united_workers_of_the_protectorates_desc:0 "Our Nevish and Soravian brothers to the north are in the same position we are. Their people are treated as slaves, and the fruits of their labor are stolen from them to feed a bloated Imperialist regime. They will know that their plight is almost over! Together, we shall free the workers of the continent, and lead the world into a brighter future!"
CWE_the_labor_wardens:0 "The Labor Wardens"
CWE_the_labor_wardens_desc:0 "More and more, people who had been part of the original People's Party are joining our cause, and depriving the Fascists of what power they had in it. As our movement grows, our power becomes ever greater."

CWE_prepare_the_red_guard_desc:0 "As we move ever closer to the People's Revolution, our ranks have grown and matured to the point that we are able to begin organizing our comrades into armed forces, ready to take on the militaries of the oppressors."
CWE_prepare_weapon_caches:0 "Prepare Weapon Caches"
CWE_prepare_weapon_caches_desc:0 "Since we do not formally control territory, we do not have a storage zone to stock up in preparation for war, and even if we did, it would be too much of a risk that the enemy could find and destroy it before we are ready to overthrow them. Instead, we will store small supply caches around the country, with their locations known only to our fellows, so that once the Revolution begins, they will be able to rearm themselves without need for logistic lines."
CWE_revolutionary_spirit:0 "Revolutionary Spirit"
CWE_revolutionary_spirit_desc:0 "Our brothers in the coming struggle prepare every day for the time when they may reclaim their homelands from the tyrants that occupy it. The pigs gorge themselves on the stolen fruits of labor, while we ready our minds and hearts for the days to come!"
CWE_the_great_struggle:0 "The Great Struggle"
CWE_the_great_struggle_desc:0 "We have made ourselves known to the world at large, and the Great Foe have begun to mobilize their slave armies to face us, feeding them lies about how we are merely upstart autocrats that wish to take their place and destroy the nation. Our comrades, with heavy hearts, march forth to meet the soldiers raised by the imperialist scum that infests our home."
CWE_export_the_revolution:0 "Export the Revolution"
CWE_export_the_revolution_desc:0 "With the inevitable march of the Workers having crushed the skulls of the slavers in Caovia, it is time to march to all corners of the globe. South, to the Velish. North, to the icy lands beyond the Nevish, and across the oceans west and east, to free all of mankind from the oppression they may face."

CWE_the_council_on_industrial_development:0 "The Council On Industrial Development"
CWE_the_council_on_industrial_development_desc:0 "Unlike the despots to our south, we Caovians have always had groups decide on matters of state. As politics and war increasingly intermingle, why should the fuel for the inevitable conflicts be any different?"
CWE_the_port_of_whedons_row:0 "The Port of Whedon's Row"
CWE_the_port_of_whedons_row_desc:0 "After we were forced out of our old capital of Sunhaven, we have had to base our government out of Whedon's Row. Even though Whedon's Row is located on the trade-rich eastern shores, the city had never been a main trading hub of our nation. As such, it is sorely lacking in suitable infrastructure for the needs of the military command and the bureaucracy. We will need to begin development on several projects within the city, which will hopefully help create jobs for the unemployed, and bolster the city's administrative capacities."
CWE_repair_central_infastructure:0 "Repair Central Infrastructure"
CWE_repair_central_infastructure_desc:0 "Our nation has thrived on trade, and the only thing more important than making products is transporting them. We should look to repair our railways, as they have fallen into disrepair over the years. Surely, something a bit stronger than just iron would be suitable for our rails?"
CWE_the_elksford_rail_line:0 "The Elksford Rail Line"
CWE_the_elksford_rail_line_desc:0 "The town of Elksford is an important manufacturing hub, but it is part of our northern territories, and is far from the frontlines. Building a railway here would make it much easier to move supplies from the factories to the battlefield, as well as making transportation cheaper. It will take some time to complete the project, as we need to bring up materials, but thankfully it's possible that we could connect the Elksford railway to our infrastructure projects in central Caovia, which will open the icy city to the rest of the nation."
CWE_create_the_lochan_birth_rail_hub:0 "Create The Lochan Birth Rail Hub"
CWE_create_the_lochan_birth_rail_hub_desc:0 "Lochan Birth is located in the central regions of our nation. It would be the perfect railroad junction for connecting the eastern and western portions of our empire's railway systems. Not only will we be able to ship goods from one half to the other, but troops and communications will be able to quickly travel wherever they're needed."
CWE_revive_the_ancient_capital:0 "Revive the Ancient Capital"
CWE_revive_the_ancient_capital_desc:0 "It has been many years since the southern barbarians had burned our great capital. With our recent advances, we have managed to push the Velish troops out of Sunhaven. Soon, Caovish flags will fly over the proud city once more."
CWE_reoccupy_the_ward:0 "Reoccupy the Ward"
CWE_reoccupy_the_ward_desc:0 "With the city of Sunhaven back in its owners' hands, we can finally begin rebuilding the homes, and filling in the shell craters. Once more, Sunhaven will be a bustling metropolis!"
CWE_the_domain_of_sunhaven:0 "The Domain Of Sunhaven"
CWE_the_domain_of_sunhaven_desc:0 "Though it has taken vast resources and manpower, we have restored the seat of our ancient capital back to its proper position. Already, our citizens cheer at this, for they know that with the crown jewel of the Empire in our hands once more, the war will soon be won. Perhaps the Velish would like to know how it feels to see their capital burned tk the ground, aswell…?"
CWE_the_port_of_ogmaran:0 "The Port of Ogmaran"
CWE_the_port_of_ogmaran_desc:0 "One large oddity about Ogmaran is the fact that the city, despite its level of development, is located both on a fairly small river, as well as being rather far north. Regardless, the city has been an important part of Caovia for generations, and thus is a perfect target for infrastructural investment."
CWE_port_of_buckler_sound:0 "Port of Buckler Sound"
CWE_port_of_buckler_sound_desc:0 "Located near the tip of a peninsula, Buckler Sound is lucky enough to have access to water on multiple sides while also being accessible by land. This has allowed Buckler Sound to be a place where everything from foreign merchant vessels, to upstream coastal boats, to even trains are able to pass through while selling and purchasing goods. The city has great potential, and must be nurtured and developed so that it may become even more prosperous."
CWE_skelter_course:0 "Port of Skelter Course"
CWE_skelter_course_desc:0 "Located on a major island on the western shore of the continent, Skelter Course is a vital component in our war efforts in the west. It serves as one of our main ship production sites, and its loss would be a crippling blow to our navy. We should modernize the city, and make sure it's working at maximum proficiency, so that it can out-produce any invasion, and refit our entire armada at a moment's notice."
CWE_forward_western_factories:0 "Forward Western Factories"
CWE_forward_western_factories_desc:0 "As we make advances further south, it has become apparent that transporting weapons and supplies to the frontlines is becoming more time-consuming and expensive. Our engineers have suggested that we simply build more factories, closer to the frontlines. This will fix both our transportation issues, and will bolster arms production."
CWE_facilitate_heacy_arms_plants:0 "Facilitate Heavy Arms Plants"
CWE_facilitate_heacy_arms_plants_desc:0 "As the war rages on, bigger and more complex weapons have been developed to deal with the ever-changing battlefield. Recently, it has gotten to the point where trying to produce such weapons is seriously hampering our ability to produce basic weapons in our factories, such as rifles and uniforms. These factories simply aren't built to handle the construction of large-caliber artillary shells and heavy machine guns. Our only real option is to create specialized factories that can handle the intense workload necessary for modern conflicts."

CWE_develop_nicevian_oil_fields_desc:0 "There is a great deal of oil in Nicevia. Oil sitting in the ground is oil that isn't powering our vehicles. Construction crews will be sent up to the these valuable oil fields to drill for that 'Black Gold'."

CWE_the_port_of_viper_pit_desc:0 "A large river flows through the region of Viper Pit, which has allowed shipping to pass through the city of Kirknell. Though it may not be feasible to widen the river to accommodate more shipping, we can still do other things to ensure that the city can output as many supplies as possible."

CWE_endless_foundries:0 "Endless Foundries"
CWE_endless_foundries_desc:0 "Endless Shores was once a trading hub that brought in vast riches from far away lands. It's said that on any given day, you could spot at least one new flag flying over a ship docked at the massive harbor. While today, you're unlikely to see anything floating there besides gunboats or transport barges, Endless could still be used to produce a great deal of supplies for the Warden Empire, whether they come from overseas or not."

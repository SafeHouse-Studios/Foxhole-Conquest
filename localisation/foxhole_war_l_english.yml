 CWE_WAR_LOC:0 "The Wardens are the (former) inhabitants of most of Caoiva. Their former capital was Sun's Haven (Abandoned Ward), but it was destroyed in the Great War and since then the Wardens operate Wheadon's Row. They are proud of their former general Callahan, who is also known as “The Emperor”. It is known that they were a Trading Empire.  The Wardens are now led by a Military Junta who are fueled for war… will you (and your government) lead to war and if so, to victory…?"
 MCA_WAR_LOC:0 "The Colonials are described both as invaders or liberators. Their Capital is between two large lakes and is called Damakrato. They are a republic and proud of it too. War is what they are known for, and much of their income is into Military forces. After being led by leaders in the Senate, the remaining Senators formed a council to lead the Republic. Will your strength be in the Military… or will it be in peace?"

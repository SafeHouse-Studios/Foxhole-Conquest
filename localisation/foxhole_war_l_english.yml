 FOXHOLE_WAR_DESC:0 "As the 8th century draws to an end the armies of the Caovish Empire and her allies and the Colonial Republic remain locked in bloody stalemate. As the Colonials breach the mighty Bulwark, Sunhaven is abandoned, and the Warden army has been pushed into the icy depths of the North. However, the Caovish eagle remains strong as recent gains by the Wardens have proven. It is up to you, the player, to decide the fate of this sprawling world by taking command of either the Warden Armies or the Colonial Legions to end this brutal conflict!"
 CWE_WAR_LOC:0 "The Warden Empire and her allies in recent years have been able to push the enclosing Colonial menace nearly back to the ancient walls which once contained their vile corruption. With the old Caovish capital of Sunhaven set to be liberated it seems that the Wardens may soon be able to finally crush their enemies once and for all in the name of their glorious emperor, Callahan. As the player(s) it is up to you to control the vast armies and fleets of the Warden military as they achieve victory through their discipline and heritage. Victory is your heritage!"

Currently hundreds of addtional legions from around the republic prepare for their march North to finally defeat the Caovish hounds once and for all in the name of the Colonial Senate. As the player(s) it is up to you to control the vast colonial legions at your behest to and destroy and defeat the tyrannical Warden Empire. Ad Victoriam!"

Client vessel states of the Caovish Empire such as Soravia or Nicevia provide much needed resources to the Warden war effort as well as bolster their armies through volunteers. Similarly various colonies are united among the larger nations of Mesea and Veli against the Caovish threat in return for repersentation in the Colonial Senate. Such include the oil rich desert lands of Kraunia, the fertile fields of Therizo, and the industrial city state of Dimiourg. While such protecterates and colonies are initially unplayable, progressing through the focus trees of their associated nation will allow you to presume control over them directly in some cases, weather that continue to be through loyalty or through bloody revolution is up to you, the player"

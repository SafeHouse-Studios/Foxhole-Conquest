 FOXHOLE_WAR_DESC:0 "As the 8th century draws to an end the armies of the Caovish Empire and her allies and the Colonial Republic remain locked in bloody stalemate. As the Colonials breach the mighty Bulwark, Sunhaven is abandoned, and the Warden army has been pushed into the icy depths of the North. However, the Caovish eagle remains strong as recent gains by the Wardens have proven. It is up to you, the player, to decide the fate of this sprawling world by taking command of either the Warden Armies or the Colonial Legions to end this brutal conflict!"
 CWE_WAR_LOC:0 "The Wardens are the (former) inhabitants of most of Caoiva. Their former capital was Sun's Haven (Abandoned Ward), but it was destroyed in the Great War and since then the Wardens operate Wheadon's Row. They are proud of their former general Callahan, who is also known as “The Emperor”. It is known that they were a Trading Empire.  The Wardens are now led by a Military Junta who are fueled for war… will you (and your government) lead to war and if so, to victory…?"
 MCA_WAR_LOC:0 "The Colonials are described both as invaders or liberators. Their Capital is between two large lakes and is called Damakrato. They are a republic and proud of it too. War is what they are known for, and much of their income is into Military forces. After being led by leaders in the Senate, the remaining Senators formed a council to lead the Republic. Will your strength be in the Military… or will it be in peace?"

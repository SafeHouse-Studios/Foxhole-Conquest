CWE_the_council_on_industrial_development:0 "The Council On Industrial Development"
CWE_the_council_on_industrial_development_desc:0 "Unlike the despots to our south, we Caovians have always had groups decide on matters of state. As politics and war increasingly intermingle, why should the fuel for the inevitable conflicts be any different?"
CWE_the_port_of_whedons_row:0 "The Port of Whedon's Row"
CWE_the_port_of_whedons_row_desc:0 "After we were forced out of our old capital of Sunhaven, we have had to base our government out of Whedon's Row. Even though Whedon's Row is located on the trade-rich eastern shores, the city had never been a main trading hub of our nation. As such, it is sorely lacking in suitable infrastructure for the needs of the military command and the bureaucracy. We will need to begin development on several projects within the city, which will hopefully help create jobs for the unemployed, and bolster the city's administrative capacities."
CWE_repair_central_infastructure:0 "Repair Central Infrastructure"
CWE_repair_central_infastructure_desc:0 "Our nation has thrived on trade, and the only thing more important than making products is transporting them. We should look to repair our railways, as they have fallen into disrepair over the years. Surely, something a bit stronger than just iron would be suitable for our rails?"
CWE_the_elksford_rail_line:0 "The Elksford Rail Line"
CWE_the_elksford_rail_line_desc:0 "The town of Elksford is an important manufacturing hub, but it is part of our northern territories, and is far from the front lines. Building a railway here would make it much easier to move supplies from the factories to the battlefield, as well as making transportation cheaper. It will take some time to complete the project, as we need to bring up materials, but thankfully it's possible that we could connect the Elksford railway to our infrastructure projects in central Caovia, which will open the icy city to the rest of the nation."
CWE_create_the_lochan_birth_rail_hub:0 "Create The Lochan Birth Rail Hub"
CWE_create_the_lochan_birth_rail_hub_desc:0 "Lochan Berth is located in the central regions of our nation. It would be the perfect railroad junction for connecting the eastern and western portions of our empire's railway systems. Not only will we be able to ship goods from one half to the other, but troops and communications will be able to quickly travel wherever they're needed."
CWE_revive_the_ancient_capital:0 "Revive the Ancient Capital"
CWE_revive_the_ancient_capital_desc:0 "It has been many years since the southern barbarians have burned our great capital. With our recent advances, we have managed to push the Velish troops out of Sunhaven. Soon, Caovish flags will fly over the proud city once more."
CWE_reoccupy_the_ward:0 "Reoccupy the Ward"
CWE_reoccupy_the_ward_desc:0 "With the city of Sunhaven back in its owners' hands, we can finally begin rebuilding the buildings, and filling in the shell craters. Once more, Sunhaven will be a bustling metropolis!"
CWE_the_domain_of_sunhaven:0 "The Domain Of Sunhaven"
<<<<<<< Updated upstream
CWE_the_domain_of_sunhaven_desc:0 "Though it has taken vast resources and manpower, we have restored the seat of our ancient capital back to its proper position. Already, our citizens cheer at this, for they know that with the crown jewel of the Empire in our hands once more, the war will soon be won. Perhaps the Velish would like to know how it feels to see their capital burned to the ground, aswell…?"

>>>>>>> Stashed changes
CWE_the_port_of_ogmaran:0 "The Port of Ogmaran"
CWE_the_port_of_ogmaran_desc:0 "One large oddity about Ogmaran is the fact that the city, despite its level of development, is located both on a fairly small river, as well as being rather far north. Regardless, the city has been an important part of Caovia for generations, and thus is a perfect target for infrastructural investment."
CWE_port_of_buckler_sound:0 "Port of Buckler Sound"
CWE_port_of_buckler_sound_desc:0 "Located near the tip of a peninsula, Buckler Sound is lucky enough to have access to water on multiple sides while also being accessible by land. This has allowed Buckler Sound to be a place where everything from foreign merchant vessels, to upstream coastal boats, to even trains are able to pass through while selling and purchasing goods. The city has great potential, and must be nurtured and developed so that it may become even more prosperous."
CWE_skelter_course:0 "Port of Skelter Course"
CWE_skelter_course_desc:0 "Located on a major island on the western shore of the continent, Skelter Course is a vital component in our war efforts in the west. It serves as one of our main ship production sites, and its loss would be a crippling blow to our navy. We should modernize the city, and make sure it's working at maximum proficiency, so that it can out-produce any invasion, and refit our entire armada at a moment's notice."
CWE_forward_western_factories:0 "Forward Western Factories"
CWE_forward_western_factories_desc:0 "As we make advances further south, it has become apparent that transporting weapons and supplies to the frontlines is becoming more time-consuming and expensive. Our engineers have suggested that we simply build more factories, closer to the frontlines. This will fix both our transportation issues, and will bolster arms production."
CWE_facilitate_heacy_arms_plants:0 "Facilitate Heavy Arms Plants"
CWE_facilitate_heacy_arms_plants_desc:0 "As the war rages on, bigger and more complex weapons have been developed to deal with the ever-changing battlefield. Recently, it has gotten to the point where trying to produce such weapons is seriously hampering our ability to produce basic weapons in our factories, such as rifles and uniforms. These factories simply aren't built to handle the construction of large-caliber artillary shells and heavy machine guns. Our only real option is to create specialized factories that can handle the intense workload necessary for modern conflicts."
CWE_build_the_ulster_dam:0 "Build the Ulster Dam"
CWE_build_the_ulster_dam_desc:0 "The Linn of Mercy’s power problems have only increased in time, and with the threat of battle looming over Ulster; we must rush the construction of a dam that can not only adequately power the region, but also serve as a new bridge that can route vehicles around Ulster rather than through it."
CWE_farranac_industrial_concern:0 "Farranac Industrial Concern"
CWE_farranac_industrial_concern_desc:0 "Although not the safest land to develop, Faranac Coast has some of the underdeveloped land for factories. We should auction off shares of state concern with generous land subsidies for the region, in order to drive growth in the area."
CWE_develop_nicevian_oil_fields:0 "Develop Nicevian Oil Fields"
CWE_develop_nicevian_oil_fields_desc:0 "There is a great deal of oil in Nicevia. Oil sitting in the ground is oil that isn't powering our vehicles. Construction crews will be sent up to the these valuable oil fields to drill for that 'Black Gold'."
CWE_develop_snowfal_refineries:0 "Develop Snowfal Refineries"
CWE_develop_snowfal_refineries_desc:0 "With recent expansions in its iron industries, the Nevish iron mines will welcome an expansion to their ore processing abilities with some new refineries. With much of the infrastructure already there, Snowfall can quickly and easily become a hub of iron refining."
CWE_pace_extraction:0 "Pace Extraction"
CWE_pace_extraction_desc:0 "Some of our advisors have pointed out that we should try to pace ourselves in the extraction of Nevish resources. Some argue that the Nevish population isn’t taking kindly to our increasingly parasitic “union”; others point to growing Nevish nationalism that we should make an effort to curb the spread of."
CWE_increase_labor_quotas:0 "Increase Labor Quotas"
CWE_increase_labor_quotas_desc:0 "The Nevish may have be Wardens in name, but to truly be Wardens they must act the part. A true Warden spends at least 10 hours a day at work, and if we have to increase their working horse by force, so be it. This step is vital to their conversion to our culture and must be heavily supervised."
CWE_the_port_of_viper_pit:0 "The Port Of Viper Pit"
CWE_the_port_of_viper_pit_desc:0 "A large river flows through the region of Viper Pit, which has allowed shipping to pass through the city of Kirknell. Though it may not be feasible to widen the river to accommodate more shipping, we can still do other things to ensure that the city can output as many supplies as possible."
CWE_port_of_rime:0 "Port Of Rime"
CWE_port_of_rime_desc:0 "Port of Rime, a longtime gateway to the East may be one of the best parts of the world to conduct economic warfare, sadly we’re going to need more than paper cuts to fight the Colonial horde. The High command wants the port transformed into a city capable of basing our Eastern fleet and staging and supplying a potential naval invasion of Tempest Island."
CWE_port_of_axehead:0 "Port Of Axehead"
CWE_port_of_axehead_desc:0 "Although a lot closer to the Colonial menace, the port of Axehead’s proximity to the frontlines makes it an excellent base for water born logistics on the eastern coast. It’s geography protects it from an immediate naval invasion and submarine attacks, and is a short trip away from the Port of Rime naval base."
CWE_forward_eastern_factories:0 "Forward Eastern Factories"
CWE_forward_eastern_factories_desc:0 "It takes weeks for supplies assembled North of Viper’s Pit to arrive in a soldier’s hands, to reduce logistical delays, we plan on constructing a series of factories on our east. These new munition plants  will be defended by river lines, and will give our fighting men on the Eastern Front what they need when they need it."
CWE_focus_land_infastructure_development:0 "Focus Land Infastructure Development"
CWE_focus_land_infastructure_development_desc:0 "Our logistics core keeps losing trucks to our second greatest enemies, mud and snow. Should we improve the state of our terrestrial infrastructure, our logistics network would no longer be limited by terrain. We also wouldn’t risk naval raiding even in the supposed safety of our rivers."
CWE_smokestacks_of_maldens_veil:0 "Smokestacks of Malden's Veil"
CWE_smokestacks_of_maldens_veil_desc:0 "Maiden’s Veil, gateway to the East, has seen a huge increase in population due to refugees from the last war. We see this as the perfect opportunity to integrate them into the warm hearted people of Maiden’s Veil, by having them shovel iron into a series of blast furnaces. By turning Maiden’s Veil into an industrial center we can employ this new workforce in new state of the art factories."
CWE_endless_foundries:0 "Endless Foundries"
CWE_endless_foundries_desc:0 "Endless Shores was once a trading hub that brought in vast riches from far away lands. It's said that on any given day, you could spot at least one new flag flying over a ship docked at the massive harbor. While today, you're unlikely to see anything floating there besides gunboats or transport barges, Endless could still be used to produce a great deal of supplies for the Warden Empire, whether they come from overseas or not."
CWE_develop_soravian_aluminium_mines:0 "Develop Soravian Aluminium Mines"
CWE_develop_soravian_aluminium_mines_desc:0 "For whatever reason, there seems to be an abnormally large amount of aluminum ore located in Sorovia. This material would be perfect for usage in many of our war machines, as well as for civilian usage. It would be foolish of us to ignore how valuable this land is, and thus we should begin preparations to excavate the aluminum, and bring it back to Caovia for refinement."
CWE_forges_of_red_chapel:0 "Forges of Red Chapel"
CWE_forges_of_red_chapel_desc:0 "Unlike many places in Caovia, Sorovian cities are not very dense, and often times they lack the kind of advanced infrastructure that would otherwise allow them to produce the materials required to fight modern wars. If we want, we could begin building refineries for all of the aluminum we're digging up in Sorovia. It would help kick-start some actual development in the region, as well as lessen the burden on refineries all the way down in Caovia."
CWE_rapid_development:0 "Rapid Development "
CWE_rapid_development_desc:0 "The lands of Sorovia are woefully underdeveloped. This is unacceptable. The Sorovians wished to retain their pre-industrial lifestyles, but it has become more and more obvious that such arrangements will not work. whether they like it or not, Sorovia will have to industrialize and help support the war against the Colonials far more than they are now."
CWE_balanced_development:0 "Balanced Development"
CWE_balanced_development_desc:0 "If we simply transform Sorovia overnight, we will destroy their culture and traditions, all in the name of fighting a war to protect OUR culture and traditions. Seems sort of hypocritical, no? If we wish to truly be the "Good Guys" in this war, we have to shoe that we are looking out for everyone, and not just ourselves. "
CWE_the_state_of_the_empire:0 "The State of the Empire"
CWE_the_state_of_the_empire_desc:0 "For a good portion of Caovia's existence, 'Callahan' has been the name of many people with influence and power in the various governments that had been rooted here. Currently, a man also named 'Callahan' is in control of the Caovian state. He effectively controls the country through a group of council members, who hold total loyalty to him. However, only time can tell whether this remains the status quo, or if the imperialists to the south will upend this age-old tradition."
CWE_the_divine_right:0 "The Divine Right"
CWE_the_divine_right_desc:0 "Callahan has been the name of many leaders in Caovian history. It seems almost to have a divine connection,  which grants greatness to those with the name. It seems obvious, then, that it is destiny for the emperor Callahan to lead our nation however he sees fit. It is clearly the will of the divine that Callahan be seen as the blessed individual that he is."
CWE_maintain_royal_authority:0 "Maintain Royal Authority"
CWE_maintain_royal_authority_desc:0 "Callahan has chosen a group of people to execute his will. This is how he has decided that the government will be run, and so far it has worked fine. There is no reason to disrupt or change this system, and doing so can only invite instability and chaos."
CWE_coerce_soravian_involvement:0 "Coerce Soravian Involvement"
CWE_coerce_soravian_involvement_desc:0 "The Soravians only exist because of our generosity. So far, their assistance in return has been… lackluster, to say the least. It seems that our kindness has been repaid with apathy, and worse-- during our time of need. It's clear that the Soravians need to be 'persuaded,' and shown why exactly they should be far more involved in this war than they currently are."
CWE_develop_nicevian_resources:0 "Develop Nicevian Resources"
CWE_develop_nicevian_resources_desc:0 "The Nicevian lands are abundant in resources, and imports from them made up a good chunk of our manufacturing industry. Of course, those estimates were made when we weren't involved in a war, and thus the current imports are nowhere near adequate. If the Nevish wish to remain in good standing with us, they'll have to provide much more to us than they are now."
CWE_the_imperial_army:0 "The Imperial Army"
CWE_the_imperial_army_desc:0 "To give control of any number of soldiers to a person is risky. Handing over power is an invitation to usurpers and claimants. It doesn't matter how 'professional' or 'effective' our army is, if that strength is only being used to tear down the government. What we need is not necessarily brilliant officers, but loyal ones. The divinity of Callahan is enough to see us through any darkness, we just need to ensure that our soldiers aren't being swayed towards treasonous acts. We can focus on tactical competency once our officers learn that they're only there to tell the recruits what Callahan wants them to do."
CWE_technology_reclamation:0 "Technology Reclamation"
CWE_technology_reclamation_desc:0 "Just because something is old, doesn't mean it's outdated. There are plenty of items from the past that have been lost or hidden away, which might be useful in the coming conflicts."
CWE_victory_through_tradition:0 "Victory Through Tradition"
CWE_victory_through_tradition_desc:0 "Our culture and history is stronger than the Colonials'. Our people are willing to devote themselves to something far greater than themselves, and along with that comes a determination to hold out against hardship longer than any others."
CWE_the_hands_of_callahan:0 "The Hands of Callahan"
CWE_the_hands_of_callahan_desc:0 ""They shall be my finest warriors, these men who give themselves to me. Like clay I shall mould them and in the furnace of war forge them. They will be of iron will and steely muscle. In great armour shall I clad them and with the mightiest guns will they be armed. They will have tactics, strategies and machines such that no foe can best them in battle. They are my bulwark against the Terror. They are the Defenders of Caovia. They are my Hands of Callahan and they shall know no fear.” - Emperor Callahan"
CWE_southwestern_protectorate_state:0 "Southwestern Protectorate State"
CWE_southwestern_protectorate_state_desc:0 "The island in Farranac Coast is among the biggest in the areas affected by the war. This makes it quite hard to patrol the entire shoreline, and the manpower required to do so would majorly hinder our regiments. A subservient 'nation' should be set up in the region, dedicated to both guarding and administering the island while we wage war."
CWE_southeastern_protectorate_state:0 "Southeastern Protectorate State"
CWE_southeastern_protectorate_state_desc:0 "The land of Endless Shore formed in such a way that it requires constant monitoring from military command to ensure the area is not lost. A satellite state with its own command structure would be the best way to alleviate the constant stress on our military oversight, and allow us to focus on other fronts that are in need of assistance."
CWE_reaffirm_the_nevish_alliance:0 "Reaffirm The Nevish Alliance"
CWE_reaffirm_the_nevish_alliance_desc:0 "The Nevish have previously vowed to fight by our side in wars. Once again we need their support. Should Nicevin honor its treaty, legions of Nevish conscripts will flood our recruitment centers looking to fight on the frontlines."
CWE_at_the_gates_of_demokratos:0 "At The Gates of Demokratos"
CWE_at_the_gates_of_demokratos_desc:0 "The Colonials, who once stood beyond the wall, are now cowering at the gates of Damokratos. For all of their 'Imperial Glory,' they are naught but scared animals hiding in their dens. Our soldiers have captured most of the lands between Silk Farms and The Blemish, but pockets of disorganized resistance still remain on hilltops or abandoned mineshafts. In general, the main fight is over, and our High Command has been recalled to prepare for the siege of the Colonial capital."
CWE_shielded_by_the_mountains:0 "Shielded by The Mountains"
CWE_shielded_by_the_mountains_desc:0 "Northern Caoiva is covered in mountainous terrain, which makes defending it far easier than the flatlands of the south. If worse comes to worse, the snowy peaks will be our fortresses, and the Colonial invaders will die at the foot of the mountains, just as they die at the feet of our soldiers."
CWE_his_fury_in_our_voice:0 "His Fury In Our Voice"
CWE_his_fury_in_our_voice_desc:0 "The soldiers of Callahan will do anything to serve His will. Even when outnumbered, they fight with suicidal bravery rather than retreat. Their fearsome determination shall be just as effective as any gun in driving back the Colonial invaders."
CWE_heritage_of_victory:0 "Heritage of Victory"
CWE_heritage_of_victory_desc:0 "The end result of this war will either be our total victory, or utter annihilation. All of our soldiers know this, and none fear death on the battlefield. If they flee, they will be hunted down and exterminated by the Colonial forces, and so they will fight to their last breath in hopes of sparing their families the same fate."
CWE_empower_the_war_council:0 "Empower the War Council"
CWE_empower_the_war_council_desc:0 "With war on the horizon it is essential that we shift more power to the war council. Rest assured once this crisis is abated they will relinquish their emergency powers back to the rest of the council and to the people."
CWE_militaristic_transformation:0 "Militaristic Transformation"
CWE_militaristic_transformation_desc:0 "Our armies are not fit to fight a modern war. Much of our organizational strategies and military doctrine dates back to the Winter Wars, we must update and reform our military to be ready for the Velian dogs."
CWE_armored_car_battalions:0 "Armored Car Battalions"
CWE_armored_car_battalions_desc:0 "While not the most fearsome vehicle, armored cars allow for quick strikes and motorized breakthroughs. As we continue to develop our armored car technology we can now afford to equip entire battalions with the swift vehicles."
CWE_the_niska:0 "The Niska"
CWE_the_niska_desc:0 "The natural upgrade from the armored car, the Niska allows for not only mechanized breakthroughs but also the transport of infantry. Their inclusion in our mechanized battalions will be most useful."
CWE_the_devitt:0 "The Devitt"
CWE_the_devitt_desc:0 "After several years we have finally created an effective light tank. The culmination of all our technology and efforts will hopefully be a great asset to our armies and destroy the pitiful colonial tanks. Made from tempered steel and representative of all Caovish artisanship, our enemy's armor will stand no chance against our newest masterpiece of technology, the Devitt."
CWE_integrate_militias:0 "Integrate Militias"
CWE_integrate_militias_desc:0 "Many less organized militias can be found across the empire. If we are to match the vast hordes of Colonial soldiers we must look to integrate these local militias into the Warden Army."
CWE_infantry_innovations:0 "Infantry Innovations"
CWE_infantry_innovations_desc:0 "As the war rages on we have developed much needed infantry equipment and tactics to equip our Wardens with. In the ever accelerating arms race, we must ensure that we are ahead."
CWE_warden_shock_army:0 "Warden Shock Army"
CWE_warden_shock_army_desc:0 "As most fronts devolve into brutal trench warfare, we need forces capable of breaking such stalemates. Such shocktroopers will be masters of trench warfare and armed with all manor of gas and close quarter equipment."
CWE_restructured_command:0 "Restructured Command"
CWE_restructured_command_desc:0 "As the war progresses inadequacies have been revealed in our command structure. If we are to conduct our vast armies we must have capable officers giving them clear orders at all levels. Anything less is simply unacceptable."
CWE_establish_warden_officer_academy:0 "Establish Warden Officer Academy"
CWE_establish_warden_officer_academy_desc:0 "The war has generated a massive demand for capable officers. If we are to even begin to meet this demand we must construct additional officer academies to train the next generation of Warden military leaders."
CWE_command_protocols:0 "Command Protocols"
CWE_command_protocols_desc:0 "Sometimes a commander may choose to share details of his plan, often he may not. In either case obedience must be instant and complete. Such automatic response relies on trust between commanders and those commanded, and that trust can only be obtained through leadership."
CWE_the_warden_military:0 "The Warden Military"
CWE_the_warden_military_desc:0 "Battleforged through milenia, trained vigorously almost from birth, and equipped with the finest of Caovish weaponry, there simply is no finer force to walk the continent. May the Colonial hoards break on their steel walls."
CWE_the_flood:0 "The Flood"
CWE_the_flood_desc:0 "While the Colonials may have beaten us in the race to develop a heavy tank, through careful analysis and dissection of their crude design we have now constructed a tank more than capable of rivaling their lance, the mighty Flood."
CWE_warden_artillery_batteries:0 "Warden Artillery Batteries"
CWE_warden_artillery_batteries_desc:0 "The Colonials have dug themselves deep into their holes. Only with vast saturation of artillery fire will our armies be able to advance. As such we must immediately authorize the deployment of thousands of more artillery batteries. "
CWE_combined_arms_doctrine:0 "Combined Arms Doctrine"
CWE_combined_arms_doctrine_desc:0 "A great tactician creates plans. A good tactician recognized the soundness of a plan presented to him. A fair tactician must see the plan succeed before offering approval. Those with no tactical ability at all may never understand or accept it, nor will people understand or accept the tactician. To those without that ability, those who possess it are a mystery. And when a mind is too deficient in understanding, the resulting gap is often filled with resentment. "

CWE_guardians_of_the_north_desc:0 "The Colonials have pushed us past the middle regions deep into our mountainous territory.

The empire is war made incarnate, conflict made manifest, and that is why it is perfect."
CWE_the_imperial_truth:0 "The Imperial Truth"
CWE_the_imperial_truth_desc:0 "Although Callahan is a great man, he is not necessarily a perfect ruler. Many treat him as infallible, and this has led to several failures in the government being swept under the rug. Officials should be accountable for their failures, not be allowed to wave away short-comings they didn't want to address."
CWE_depower_the_council:0 "Depower the Council"
CWE_depower_the_council_desc:0 "A group of people making decisions is a good way to run a government. What isn't a good way to run a government is to have a group of people making decisions, who all have no obligation to help anybody but themselves.

CWE_continue_the_southern_crusade_desc:0 "Regardless of our teamwork, the Colonials are still invaders. They have conquered democratic nations before, and they will do it again. For all we know, they're just using us to weaken the current Caovish government to make it easier to invade. We should prepare for the possibility of betrayal, either during or after our uprising.

CWE_underground_industry_desc:0 "t is too dangerous to produce valuable weapons and supplies out in the open. All it would take is one wayward civilian to stumble upon an armory for our cover to be blown. However, if we can hide such things underground, it would be far less dangerous for us. We could hide from prying eyes, cover up the smoke trails from the factories, and if all-else fails, hopefully the reports of hidden factories underground in the mountains, run by traitors far away from army bases will be enough to convince them that it's just a trap."

CWE_the_peoples_blade_desc:0 "As our ranks swell, we see more and more people share our dreams, and the outcome of war becomes brighter and brighter.

CWE_question_the_regime:0 "Question the Regime"
CWE_question_the_regime_desc:0 "The council is useless. It is filled by incompetent fools, who are incapable of doing their duty. They have begun to lose the respect of the Caovish people, and their authority is diminishing, whether they realize it or not. It's no longer clear if the council even represents Callahan anymore, or if they merely wish to line their own pockets."
CWE_destabilize_the_council:0 "Destabilize the Council"
CWE_destabilize_the_council_desc:0 "By worming our way into the council, we can act as a destabilizing force by pitching mock-arguments with our co-conspirators, allowing us to harm the reputation and image of the council; weakening its legitimacy."
CWE_prosecute_the_noble_class:0 "Prosecute the Noble Class"
CWE_prosecute_the_noble_class_desc:0 "The nobility is useless. They spend their lives drinking expensive wine and looking at art, instead of doing their jobs and running the government. No amount of petitioning or protests will make them change, because they're already aware of their hedonism. They just don't care. The only way they'll change is by force, and even then only as long as the knife is pressed firmly against their throats. The only solution is to remove them permanently, through intrigue and violence."
CWE_the_peoples_party:0 "The People's Party"
CWE_the_peoples_party_desc:0 "Whoever controls this nation will be one of us, not the decadent Royalists or wide-eyed Republicans. While it may be hard to admit, working alongside the other populists in the government may be our best chance to succeed, even if their views are totally misaligned with reality. Surprisingly, they agree with us, though they staunchly claim that they are the ones with a firm grasp on reality. The formation of a coalition party was agreed upon, though it will be dissolved once our mutual enemies are dealt with."
CWE_shift_the_paradigm:0 "Shift the Paradigm"
CWE_shift_the_paradigm_desc:0 "Although we have maintained a temporary alliance with the communists, they are all shortsighted fools. The future of Caovia lies not in the hands of a false emperor nor the hands of some shaky labor union barely capable of controlling their members let alone running a nation. Gideon plans to form his own splinter group more aligned with our fascist ideals."
CWE_caovish_fascist_movement:0 "Caovish Fascist Movement"
CWE_caovish_fascist_movement_desc:0 "More and more the delusions of the Communists tarnish their image. At this point, it would be in our best interests to split off from them and leave them to die out in obscurity. We have far more important matters to attend to, such as planning for how to best fix the Empire and steer it away from the impending collapse. The Colonial menace to the south eagerly eyes up our territory, and whether or not we are in charge, we have to be ready to fight them off to save the last light of hope to restore a functioning government to Caovia."
CWE_impose_authoritarian_council_members:0 "Impose Authoritarian Council Members"
CWE_impose_authoritarian_council_members_desc:0 "More and more, we are able to put competent people into the Council, slowly replacing the senile fools still left. Soon, only loyal Fascist party members will be calling the shots in the government, and we'll finally be able to get things done. We've begun drafting plans to streamline nearly every facet of governance, but there is still one massive roadblock to deal with…"
CWE_from_the_seven_sisters:0 "From the Seven Sisters"
CWE_from_the_seven_sisters_desc:0 "The time it would take to fix the current national army would be astronomical. Instead, we'll create a formal organization of strong-willed Fascist loyalists to act as the military, incase of a not-so-smooth power transfer, as well as to replace the current military until a proper solution can be created."
CWE_subjugate_protectorates:0 "Subjugate Protectorates"
CWE_subjugate_protectorates_desc:0 "Once the Fascist party is in full control, we'll have to bring Soravia and Nicievin under our control, too. It's too dangerous to allow rump-states to exist which may act against our wishes. Our top Fascist officials are drawing up plans to invade the two northern nations in case a more firm 'persuasion' is needed to bring them to heel. Surely, once they see our power on display, they will beg to join us, but it is always better to be safe than sorry"
CWE_the_nevish_fascist_party:0 "The Nevish Fascist Party"
CWE_the_nevish_fascist_party_desc:0 "The Nevish have always echoed the Caovish, and it comes as no surprise to us that they have taken to embracing Facism, just as every true Caovian citizen has. The Nicievin will prove as loyal allies in our fight against the Velian controlled Communists. But for them to help us, we must help them. Our party officers are helping spread pamphlets and leaflets to the Nicievin population in conjunction with their Facist party."
CWE_denounce_the_emperor:0 "Denounce the Emperor"
CWE_denounce_the_emperor_desc:0 "Lies and deceit! Callahan is but a puppet! At first, we believed it was strange how little we heard from the Emperor, but as we gained more and more power, it became more and more apparent that the great Callahan was nothing but a figurehead to legitimize the Council! For decades, the Council lied to Caovia about how it executed the will of Callahan, but in truth, the wishes of Callahan had nothing to do with how the government was run! With this abominable offense revealed, our plans must be put into overdrive, to save Caovia from the remaining traitors before they destroy the nation out of spite."
CWE_the_kirknell_authority:0 "The Kirknell Authority"
CWE_the_kirknell_authority_desc:0 "Once we wrestle control away from the current 'government,' we'll need to immediately fill the power vacuum left, lest we fall into petty civil wars. We have already ordered the formation of a pseudo-government in Kirknell, ready to act as an interim state while we pick up the pieces left by the old regime, as a way to keep order and prevent a full collapse of Caovia. Though, it would be hard to believe that anything could be more capable of destroying the nation than the old Council was."
CWE_slay_the_eagle:0 "Slay the Eagle"
CWE_slay_the_eagle_desc:0 "Our followers are taking their places and watching their clocks closely. In what is bound to be a future national holiday our followers are taking their places, for the start of a new future for Caovia. A series of well executed strikes are being planned to secure our regime in a day, should everything go to plan. Should our plan fail, we would rally our followers to take on the remaining Communist loyalists."

CWE_the_viper_strikes_Southward_desc:0 "As god had willed it we have won. Through our strength, Gideon has led us to victory and  we have prevailed, and a glorious new age for the Caovish people can commence. As the last of the disloyal remnants are being assigned to positions they are more suited for, we can embrace our destiny, a strike south in one final glorious victory. The final war commences, and a millenia old rivalry ends in our victory."
CWE_repair_the_nation:0 "Repair the nation"
CWE_repair_the_nation_desc:0 "Our victory in the civil war has come at heavy price, in lives as well as material. Many of our citizens don’t have access to clean water, a steady supply of food, or government sponsored information. We shall embark upon a glorious campaign to mend the wounds in our nation, and repair our infrastructure, to a state superior to that of the old regime."
CWE_the_labor_party:0 "The Labor Party"
CWE_the_labor_party_desc:0 "Though we have united with the Fascists, it does not change the fact that the only true path forward is under the unity of the workers, not politicians. The Fascists are merely autocrats that wish to use a different title to trick people into believing they are in better hands than under kings or archons. It is only through the violent uprising of the workers across Caovia that freedom can be achieved!"

Together, we shall free the workers of the continent, and lead the world into a brighter future!"
CWE_the_labor_wardens:0 "The Labor Wardens"
CWE_the_labor_wardens_desc:0 "More and more, people who had been part of the original People's Party are joining our cause, and depriving the Fascists of what power they had in it. As our movement grows, our power becomes ever greater."

CWE_prepare_the_red_guard_desc:0 "As we move ever closer to the People's Revolution, our ranks have grown and matured to the point that we are able to begin organizing our comrades into armed forces, ready to take on the militaries of the oppressors."
CWE_prepare_weapon_caches:0 "Prepare Weapon Caches"
CWE_prepare_weapon_caches_desc:0 "Since we do not formally control territory, we do not have a storage zone to stock up in preparation for war, and even if we did, it would be too much of a risk that the enemy could find and destroy it before we are ready to overthrow them. Instead, we will store small supply caches around the country, with their locations known only to our fellows, so that once the Revolution begins, they will be able to rearm themselves without need for logistic lines."
CWE_revolutionary_spirit:0 "Revolutionary Spirit"
CWE_revolutionary_spirit_desc:0 "Our brothers in the coming struggle prepare every day for the time when they may reclaim their homelands from the tyrants that occupy it. The pigs gorge themselves on the stolen fruits of labor, while we ready our minds and hearts for the days to come!"
CWE_the_great_struggle:0 "The Great Struggle"
CWE_the_great_struggle_desc:0 "We have made ourselves known to the world at large, and the Great Foe have begun to mobilize their slave armies to face us, feeding them lies about how we are merely upstart autocrats that wish to take their place and destroy the nation. Our comrades, with heavy hearts, march forth to meet the soldiers raised by the imperialist scum that infests our home."
CWE_export_the_revolution:0 "Export the Revolution"
CWE_export_the_revolution_desc:0 "With the inevitable march of the Workers having crushed the skulls of the slavers in Caovia, it is time to march to all corners of the globe. South, to the Velish. North, to the icy lands beyond the Nevish, and across the oceans west and east, to free all of mankind from the oppression they may face."
CWE_warden_aviation_initiative:0 "Warden Aviation Initiative"
CWE_warden_aviation_initiative_desc:0 "Just as new spices and materials are discovered and need to be shipped, so too do new weapons and vehicles need to be invented and produced. Research into various methods of aviation have led us to a point where we can create winged vehicles capable of flying under their own power, rather than by using hot air or a strong wind. These 'aircraft' are uniquely suited for military purposes, such as scouting enemy positions, or dropping explosives on fortifications."
CWE_the_eagles_beak:0 "The Eagle's Beak"
CWE_the_eagles_beak_desc:0 "The mighty eagle is the king of the air. In our efforts to obtain victory, we look to nature's perfection for inspiration. Just like an eagle uses its beak to strike its prey out of the skies, so too shall our planes strike Colonial aircraft from the skies, like an eagle in dive."
CWE_fighter_focus:0 "Fighter Focus"
CWE_fighter_focus_desc:0 "The Colonials have developed their own aerial crafts, which means that our planes are not the only ones in the sky. It's impossible to know where the enemy might take their aircraft designs, so we should focus on producing fighter craft to deny them access to the skies, and ensure they can't unleash any new planes upon us."
CWE_the_eagles_talon:0 "The Eagle's Talon"
CWE_the_eagles_talon_desc:0 "The mighty eagle of the lord of the skies. In our efforts to obtain victory, we seek comfort in the time-tested designs of nature. When an eagle finds a turtle, rather than strike fruitlessly with its beak, it grabs the prey in its claws, and drops it far above the ground, smashing the pitiful defenses of anything it wishes. Nothing could be more fitting for our plans to create the greatest bombers imaginable, and much like an eagle's claws, it shall puck our enemy's defenses, and drop them to their doom."
CWE_the_manticore:0 "The Manticore"
CWE_the_manticore_desc:0 "Two prevailing paths exist to take explosive-armed aircrafts; A small number of high-yield bombs, or a large number of lower-yield bombs. While it might be scary to watch a massive explosive detonate in front of you, it won't be very effective at doing much against soldiers other than kicking up a dust-screen. For aircraft to be useful in fighting against infantry, they need to be armed with weapons capable of devastating large areas of land, and the enemy that occupies it."
CWE_form_squadron_command:0 "Form Squadron Command"
CWE_form_squadron_command_desc:0 "Proper military structure is extremely important for success. So far, our avian forces are only part of our military where units are theoretically independent and have no command structure. By applying Squadron formations similar to that of our navy, we can solidify our aircraft forces into a single coherent unit, ready to rain death upon our enemies."
CWE_heavy_bomber_development:0 "Heavy Bomber Development"
CWE_heavy_bomber_development_desc:0 "As fortification designs improve, so too must fortification-busters improve. Heavy Bombers are made specifically to destroy enemy buildings and bunkers, so increasing the explosive load of each plane and the distance it can travel are vital for keeping these planes relevant, and thus furthering the development of our bombers should be a top priority for the nation."
CWE_naval_bomber_development:0 "Naval Bomber Development"
CWE_naval_bomber_development_desc:0 "It can be beneficial to surprise a trading partner with exotic goods that they have no choice but to purchase. So too can it be beneficial to surprise an enemy with fresh ideas they have no tactics to counter. While strapping bombs to the underside of a plane can be useful for destroying concrete bunkers and trenches, it is less effective at hitting a slim, moving target. The potential is there, but different designs are needed. Plans to refit the bomb-hangers on planes to carry torpedoes instead have been tossed around by a few naval officers that have been annoyed at our recent captivation with creating an "Avian Navy," and while possibly a mere joke at the time, the idea has certainly taken off, and merely needs the go-ahead from Central Command to start production on these "Naval Bombers."
CWE_skyborne_battalions:0 "Skyborne Battalions"
CWE_skyborne_battalions_desc:0 "Explosives aren't the only thing a plane can drop. Early planes were small, and the biggest could uncomfortably fit a crew of two, sometimes three. However, advances in both design and engine power have allowed the size of aircraft to increase drastically, and with it came a great deal of extra leg-room. It has been decided that the potential to drop soldiers behind enemy lines is too good to pass up, and orders for military-grade parachutes are already on their way. These "Skyborne Battalions" will be capable of reaching anywhere that our aircraft can, and would even allow us to cross otherwise inaccessible terrain with heavy machinery like tanks and field guns."
CWE_caovish_naval_legacy:0 "Caovish Naval Legacy"
CWE_caovish_naval_legacy_desc:0 "The Warden Empire was built on one simple action; Moving valuables from point A to point B. The best way to do this has always been from sailing, and because of this we have become Lords of the Sea. Our ships were top-of-the-line; made from imported woods that were tougher than Oak, and lasted longer than Cedars. Though for many decades, our control of the water has been undisputed, the uncivilized barbarians to our South have unsurprisingly not realised their place beneath our rudders... yet."
CWE_replace_traditional_naval_doctrine:0 "Replace Traditional Naval Doctrine"
CWE_replace_traditional_naval_doctrine_desc:0 "Our ships were meant to ferry gold and spices, not cannons and marines. This has been a very big issue in our battles with the Velian navy, and unless we wish to bribe their admirals with expensive and exotic goods, we will have to adapt to the new reality that our navy will be facing."
CWE_reinforce_ports_of_the_aging_ocean:0 "Reinforce Ports of the Aging Ocean"
CWE_reinforce_ports_of_the_aging_ocean_desc:0 "While we can erect barricades and walls to defend land passes, we can do no such thing in the sea. Due to our previous role as a trading empire, most of our developed cities are coastal. This makes them especially vulnerable to naval attacks. To counter this, we will need better ports to house more ships, so that any fleet launched by the Colonials can be matched and sunk before they can further terrorize our coasts."
CWE_reinforce_ports_of_the_endless_sea:0 "Reinforce Ports of the Endless Sea"
CWE_reinforce_ports_of_the_endless_sea_desc:0 "The numerous islands of the East present good opportunities for naval bases. We can combine this with increased naval productivity and docking in the long shoreline of the Endless Shore. These two could work in tandem to make the Eastern waters impenetrable, crushing any hope the Colonials might have of contesting our Eastern waters."
CWE_capital_ship_focus:0 "Capital Ship Focus"
CWE_capital_ship_focus_desc:0 "The Colonials can barely get their ships to float as is! We should focus on building massive warships that will strike fear into the hearts of our enemies. We will show them that they have no hope of winning any naval engagement with us! If we simply make a larger number of Destroyers, the enemy will believe that they have a chance of winning, and they won't stop coming. It's better to make them turn away before they engage in the first place. "An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure”."
CWE_dreadnought_development:0 "Dreadnought Development"
CWE_dreadnought_development_desc:0 "About making new bigger and better ships; Wouldn't it be great if one day, the Colonial Grand Admiralty woke up, and saw the greatest ship ever built, simply floating in their docks, with every house flying a Warden flag, without a single shot having to be fired?"
CWE_destroyer_focus:0 "Destroyer Focus"
CWE_destroyer_focus_desc:0 "While it's tempting to swing our rather large "assets" in front of the Colonials, it would be foolish to put all of our resources into a few large vessels. The Colonial navy could strike anywhere, at any time, and it's a simple fact that a slow-moving behemoth may not be able to reach the battle before it's over. Instead, we should invest in a large fleet of ships capable of fighting the enemy, and holding them in one spot until reinforcements can arrive. While their guns won't be heard for miles around, a Destroyer can still pack a punch, and will be more than enough to deal with enemy vessels."
CWE_the_ronan:0 "The Ronan"
CWE_the_ronan_desc:0 "While it's always possible that we could build a dozen different ships for a dozen different roles; we Wardens have always had a knack for finding the perfect middle ground. The Ronan will have an artillery piece, calibered to 55 millimeters, which can be used either to bombard shores, or hit slower enemy ships at a distance. The 14.5 millimeter machine gun will shred anything that dares come too close to this beast, as well as being rather nasty for anything too close to the shore while the Ronan is on the prowl."
CWE_warm_water_ports:0 "Warm Water Ports"
CWE_warm_water_ports_desc:0 "While the Colonial "ports" are hardly useful for anything other than carving canoes out of driftwood; they are a start. It would make sense to use them as a launching point to construct more ports and dockyards in the recaptured regions. Such moves would help solidify our control, and help us project our power further South, and assist in continued offensives into occupied lands."
CWE_wolf_packs:0 "Wolf Packs"
CWE_wolf_packs_desc:0 "As a nation built upon trade, we know the importance of keeping proper supply routes and safe shipping lanes. With the development of submersible vessels, it has become vastly easier to hunt down the unarmed shipping vessels delivering guns and food to the invaders on land. They'll never see it coming."
CWE_the_meterora:0 "The Meterora"
CWE_the_meterora_desc:0 "Having 'nough Dakka' is merely a myth. No true Warden would ever believe such blasphemy."
CWE_induct_nievish_admiralty:0 "Induct Nievish Admiralty"
CWE_induct_nievish_admiralty_desc:0 "The Nevish could potentially prove useful to our naval corp, it would be foolish to overlook potential loyal captains and admirals because of the flag that flew on the door of the home they were raised in. Of course, the public will likely see this as a betrayal of Caovish culture in a war primarily paid for in Caovish blood."
CWE_maintain_the_traditional_caovish_admiralty:0 "Maintain the Traditional Caovish Admiralty"
CWE_maintain_the_traditional_caovish_admiralty_desc:0 "It has been Caovia that rules the waves, and it will be Caovia that rules the waves! Years of naval dominance has bred a love of the open ocean and the scent of the salty sea air into every man, woman and child in the Warden Empire. To allow just anyone to command a Caovian vessel would be a stain upon our history and heritage. It's simply illogical that anyone could be a better captain than someone who learns to swim before they learn to walk."
CWE_the_warden_navy:0 "The Warden Navy"
CWE_the_warden_navy_desc:0 "Every day, our ships win battle after battle against the Colonial threat. It has become clear that retaking the entirety of the seas will be an inevitability, and we hope the Colonials have realized such. It is, after all, a shame that their sunken wrecks pollute our sea, and their corpses sully our beautiful waters."
CWE_naval_supremacy:0 "Naval Supremacy"
CWE_naval_supremacy_desc:0 "As we have predicted, we have retaken the oceans from the Colonial menace! Our ships sail the waters with impunity, and the enemy would not so much as fish on the shoreline without suffering a retaliatory strike. The Colonials thought they could muscle into our ocean and take it from us, they were wrong."
